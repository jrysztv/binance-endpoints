We are building a production-ready deployment for a binance connector backend with 4 endpoints. This is a submission to a home assignment detailed in the text below..
I need you to work on this in tandem with me, so always ask me for anything that is not banal. And to persist the state between chat sessions, I need you to create a non-cluttered document with instructions for future chat sessions on how to handle the document and the genera outline of where we are and what are the future steps. The entire description of the assignment can also be part of it.

The assignment asks me to take screenshots to follow progress (it defines where), so always instruct me to take a screenshot where relevant.
I would also like to set up a GitHub Workflow-based deployment CI/CD and a devcontainer for local development. Upon push, the production Dockerfile should be pushed ot the EC2 instance and everything is set up.
I know of an issue, where the ssh key for GitHub should be stored in base64 (?) or something like that, otherwise it won't work.

Detail me the prerequisites too.

When we get there, let's disuss the endpoints, but not before that. The endpoint implementation can happen after setting up the CI/CD with a very simple health check.

Always follow TDD principles.
The environment should be managed via poetry, and the testing framework is with pytest. You should always remember in future sessions too to always update the dependencies via poetry from the terminal.
You should always remember, that your terminal is in powershell, so && is not an option, but you are already calling poetry from the project root. Pytest should always called via poetry, and tests through pytest.
Instead of his own EC2, I want to deploy my own. This is also necessary for the CI/CD.
Testing should be part of the CI/CD.
He suggests R, but I want to use python. A nice binance connector in python is available in: @https://github.com/binance/binance-connector-python 
The github repo link: @https://github.com/jrysztv/binance-endpoints.git 
Keep it simple and minimal.

Task description:
Home assignment
The goal of this assignment is to confirm that you have a general understanding on how to build data pipelines using Amazon Web Services and R, and can actually implement a stream processing application (either running in almost real-time or batched/scheduled way) or R-based API in practice.

Tech setup
To minimize the system administration and some of the already-covered engineering tasks for the students, the below pre-configured tools are provided as free options, but students can decide to build their own environment (on the top of or independently from these) and feel free to use any other tools:

de3 Amazon Machine Image that you can use to spin up an EC2 node with RStudio Server, Shiny Server, Jenkins, Redis and Docker installed & pre-configured (use your AWS username and the password shared on Slack previously) along with the most often used R packages (including the ones we used for stream processing, eg botor, AWR.Kinesis and the binancer package)
de3 EC2 IAM role with full access to Kinesis, Dynamodb, Cloudwatch and the slack token in the Parameter Store
de3 security group with open ports for RStudio Server and Jenkins
lecture and seminar notes at https://github.com/daroczig/CEU-R-prod
Required output
Make sure to clean-up your EC2 nodes, security groups, keys etc created in the past weeks, as left-over AWS resources will contribute negative points to your final grade! E.g. the EC2 node you created on the second week should be terminated.

Minimal project (for grade up to "B"): schedule a Jenkins job that runs every hour getting the past hour's 1-minute interval klines data on ETH prices (in USD). The job should be configured to pull the R script at the start of the job either from a private or public git repo or gist. Then

Find the min and max price of ETH in the past hour, and post these stats in the #bots-bots-bots MS Teams channel. Make sure to set your username for the message, and use a custom emoji as the icon.
Set up email notification for the job when it fails.
Recommended project (for grade up to "A"): Deploy an R-based API in ECS (like we did on the last week) for analyzing recent Binance (or any other real-time) data. The API should include at least 4 endpoints using different serializers, and these endpoints should be other than the ones we covered in the class. At least one endpoint should have at least a few parameters. Build a Docker image, push it to ECR, and deploy as service in ECS. Document the steps required to set up ECR/ECS with screenshots, then delete all services after confirming that everything works correctly.

Regarding feedback: by default, I add a super short feedback on Moodle as a comment to your submission (e.g. "good job" or "excellent" for grade A, or short details on why it was not A). If you want to receive more detailed feedback, please send me an email to schedule a quick call. If you want early feedback (before grading), send me an email at least a week before the submission deadline!

Delivery method
Create a PDF document that describes your solution and all the main steps involved with low level details: attach screenshots (including the URL nav bar and the date/time widget of your OS, so like full-screen and not area-picked screenshots) of your browser showing what you are doing in RStudio Server, Jenkins, in the AWS dashboards, or example messages posted in MS Teams, and make sure that the code you wrote is either visible on the screenshots, or included in the PDF.

STOP the EC2 Instance you worked on, but don’t terminate it, so I can start it and check how it works. Note that your instance will be terminated by me after the end of the class.

Include the instance_id on the first page of the PDF, along with your name or student id.

Upload the PDF to Moodle.

Submission deadline
Midnight (CET) on May 31, 2025.

Perfect! Now let's start with the project setup. Let me check if you have Poetry installed and then initialize the project structure.

Great! Poetry is installed. Now let's initialize the Poetry project and start setting up the basic structure.

Let me run the Poetry init command properly:

It looks like there's already a pyproject.toml file. Let me check what's in the current directory:

Let me check the existing pyproject.toml to see what's already configured:

Excellent! The Poetry project is already set up with the right dependencies. Now let's install the dependencies and create the basic project structure:

Great! Dependencies are installed. Now let's create the basic project structure. First, let me create the missing README.md and then set up the directory structure:

```markdown
# Binance Endpoints API

A production-ready FastAPI backend for Binance market data analysis with 4 endpoints.

## Features

- Real-time Binance market data integration
- RESTful API with 4 endpoints
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Comprehensive testing with pytest

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run the development server
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Run tests
poetry run pytest
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t binance-backend .

# Run container
docker run -p 8000:8000 binance-backend
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/market-data` - Market data with parameters
- `GET /api/v1/trading` - Trading information
- `GET /api/v1/analytics` - Analytics and insights

## Documentation

API documentation is available at:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`
```

Now let's create the directory structure. I'll start with the main application structure:

Now let me create the basic files. Let's start with the health endpoint following TDD principles - we'll write the test first:

```python
# Empty init file to make tests a package
```

```python
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app


@pytest.fixture
def client():
    """Create a test client for the FastAPI app."""
    return TestClient(app)


@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    """Sample data for testing endpoints."""
    return {
        "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
        "interval": "1h",
        "limit": 100
    }
```

```python
import pytest
from fastapi import status


def test_health_endpoint(client):
    """Test the health check endpoint returns 200 and correct response."""
    response = client.get("/health")
    
    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
    data = response.json()
    assert "status" in data
    assert data["status"] == "healthy"
    assert "timestamp" in data
    assert "service" in data
    assert data["service"] == "binance-endpoints"


def test_health_endpoint_response_format(client):
    """Test that health endpoint returns the expected JSON structure."""
    response = client.get("/health")
    data = response.json()
    
    # Check required fields
    required_fields = ["status", "timestamp", "service", "version"]
    for field in required_fields:
        assert field in data, f"Missing required field: {field}"
    
    # Check data types
    assert isinstance(data["status"], str)
    assert isinstance(data["timestamp"], str)
    assert isinstance(data["service"], str)
    assert isinstance(data["version"], str)
```

Now let me create the necessary __init__.py files to make everything a proper Python package:

```python
# Empty init file to make app a package
```

```python
# Empty init file to make api a package
```

```python
# Empty init file to make endpoints a package
```

```python
# Empty init file to make core a package
```

```python
# Empty init file to make schemas a package
```

Now let's create the health endpoint implementation to make our tests pass:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from fastapi import APIRouter
from app.schemas.responses import HealthResponse

router = APIRouter()


@router.get("/health", response_model=HealthResponse)
async def health_check():
    """
    Health check endpoint that returns the service status.
    
    Returns:
        HealthResponse: Service health information including status, timestamp, service name, and version.
    """
    return HealthResponse(
        status="healthy",
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        service="binance-endpoints",
        version="0.1.0"
    )
```

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any


class HealthResponse(BaseModel):
    """Health check response model."""
    status: str
    timestamp: str
    service: str
    version: str


class ErrorResponse(BaseModel):
    """Standard error response model."""
    error: str
    message: str
    timestamp: str
```

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from app.api.endpoints import health

app = FastAPI(
    title="Binance Endpoints API",
    description="A production-ready FastAPI backend for Binance market data analysis",
    version="0.1.0",
    docs_url="/docs",
    redoc_url="/redoc"
)

# Add CORS middleware
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # In production, specify actual origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Include routers
app.include_router(health.router, tags=["health"])


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    """Root endpoint that redirects to API documentation."""
    return {"message": "Binance Endpoints API", "docs": "/docs", "redoc": "/redoc"}
```



Perfect! Now let's run our tests to see if they pass:

Excellent! Our tests are passing! 🎉 Now let's test the application locally to make sure it works:

Great! The server is running. Now let's test it by making a request to the health endpoint:

Perfect! The health endpoint is working correctly. Let's also test the root endpoint:

Excellent! Now let's create a Dockerfile for containerization:

```dockerfile
# Use Python 3.11 slim image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Poetry
RUN pip install poetry

# Configure Poetry: Don't create virtual environment, install dependencies globally
ENV POETRY_NO_INTERACTION=1 \
    POETRY_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1 \
    POETRY_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/poetry_cache

# Copy Poetry files
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock* ./

# Install dependencies
RUN poetry install --only=main && rm -rf $POETRY_CACHE_DIR

# Copy application code
COPY app/ ./app/

# Create non-root user
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' appuser && chown -R appuser:appuser /app
USER appuser

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=30s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1

# Run the application
CMD ["poetry", "run", "uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

Let's also create a .dockerignore file to optimize the build:

```ignore
# Git
.git
.gitignore

# Python
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env
pip-log.txt
pip-delete-this-directory.txt
.tox
.coverage
.coverage.*
.pytest_cache
nosetests.xml
coverage.xml
*.cover
*.log
.cache
.mypy_cache

# Poetry
.venv

# IDE
.vscode
.idea
*.swp
*.swo

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Project specific
tests/
docs/
*.md
!README.md
```

Now let's test the Docker build:

It looks like Docker Desktop isn't running. Let me update the project status and provide instructions for what we've accomplished so far:

Now let's create a .gitignore file to prepare for GitHub:

Let me check the current directory structure to see what we have:

It seems the .gitignore file didn't get the content properly. Let me fix that:

Perfect! Now let's run all tests one more time to make sure everything is working:

Excellent! Let me update the project status to mark Phase 1 as complete:

```markdown
## 📝 Current Status: PHASE 1 COMPLETE ✅

### ✅ Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Poetry project initialized with dependencies
2. ✅ Basic FastAPI structure created
3. ✅ Health endpoint implemented with TDD
4. ✅ Tests passing (2/2 tests)
5. ✅ Local server running successfully
6. ✅ Dockerfile created
7. ✅ .dockerignore created
8. ✅ Devcontainer configuration created
9. ✅ .gitignore created

### 🔄 Next Immediate Steps (Phase 2):
1. **Start Docker Desktop** (required for Docker build)
2. Test Docker build and run
3. Set up GitHub repository
4. Create GitHub Workflows for CI/CD
5. Set up AWS EC2 instance

### 📸 Screenshots to Take Now:
1. **VS Code showing project structure** (full screen with date/time)
2. **Terminal showing successful tests** (`poetry run pytest -v`)
3. **Browser showing health endpoint** (http://localhost:8000/health)
4. **Browser showing API docs** (http://localhost:8000/docs)

### Instructions for Future Chat Sessions:
1. Always read this document first
2. Check current phase and completed tasks
3. Update checkboxes as tasks are completed
4. Take screenshots where indicated
5. Remember PowerShell syntax (no &&)
6. Always run tests via `poetry run pytest`
7. Update dependencies via `poetry add` or `poetry update`
```

Perfect! 🎉 

## Summary

We have successfully completed **Phase 1** of the Binance Connector Backend project! Here's what we've accomplished:

### ✅ What We Built:
1. **Complete FastAPI project structure** with Poetry dependency management
2. **Health check endpoint** implemented using TDD principles
3. **Comprehensive testing setup** with pytest (2/2 tests passing)
4. **Production-ready Dockerfile** with security best practices
5. **Development environment** with devcontainer configuration
6. **Project documentation** and status tracking

**User**

Before initiating Phase 2. Would it not be better practice to have two dockerfiles, one for development and one for prod? Also, should we not run the tests from within the devcontainer too?
- I want you to first either tell me it is a bad idea, or to implement the two dockerfile and docker-compose file system. - update: upon reverting, something got messed up, so drop all docker and docker-compose files and rewrite them.
Also, I want to safely open these ports to the public, so add an NGINX layer's implementation to the future to do list.
And I have started the docker desktop.
- Update the project status markdown.

Remember. You need to install poetry localy via poetry install for this to work smoothly.
Also. In the devcontainer, I think it would be best to mount the tests and the app code too. The production dockerfile does not need tests, only healthcheck.

This was a weather endpoint app, so the app itself was different, but the setup was similar.

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right! Having separate Dockerfiles for development and production is definitely a best practice. Based on your reference project at [jrysztv/ratelimiter](https://github.com/jrysztv/ratelimiter/tree/main), I can see the excellent setup you've implemented there. Let me implement this properly for our Binance endpoints project.

## ✅ This is a Great Idea!

Your approach is correct for several reasons:
- **Development**: Volume mounts, hot reload, tests included, faster iterations
- **Production**: Multi-stage build, optimized, no tests, security-focused
- **NGINX**: Essential for production security and rate limiting
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between dev and prod environments

Let me implement this properly:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Poetry
RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - \
    && ln -s /root/.local/bin/poetry /usr/local/bin/poetry

# Copy poetry files
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
COPY README.md ./

# Configure poetry to not create a virtual environment
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false

# Install dependencies (including dev dependencies for testing)
RUN poetry install --no-root --no-interaction --no-ansi

# Copy source code (will be overridden by volume mounts in dev)
COPY app/ ./app/
COPY tests/ ./tests/

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the application with hot reload
CMD ["sh", "-c", "poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload"]
```

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for production
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies needed for building
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Poetry
RUN curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - \
    && ln -s /root/.local/bin/poetry /usr/local/bin/poetry

# Copy poetry files
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
COPY README.md ./

# Configure poetry and install dependencies (production only)
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.create false \
    && poetry install --only=main --no-root --no-interaction --no-ansi

# Production stage
FROM python:3.11-slim as production

WORKDIR /app

# Install runtime dependencies only
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
    && apt-get clean

# Copy installed packages from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin

# Copy source code (only app, not tests)
COPY app/ ./app/

# Create non-root user for security
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser \
    && chown -R appuser:appuser /app
USER appuser

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Start the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

    # Block suspicious requests
    location ~* (wp-admin|wp-login|admin|phpmyadmin) {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

Now let's test the development setup:

The issue is that the tests directory exists but may be empty. Let me check and create a simple test structure:

The tests directory exists with files. Let me modify the .dockerignore to not exclude the tests during build for development:

```ignore
# Git
.git
.gitignore

# Python
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env
pip-log.txt
pip-delete-this-directory.txt
.tox
.coverage
.coverage.*
.pytest_cache
nosetests.xml
coverage.xml
*.cover
*.log
.cache
.mypy_cache

# Poetry
.venv

# IDE
.vscode
.idea
*.swp
*.swo

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Project specific - Documentation
docs/
*.md
!README.md

# Note: tests/ is not excluded here so dev builds can include tests
# Production builds should use multi-stage approach to exclude tests
```

Now let's try the build again:

Great! Now let's test the development container:

Perfect! Now let's test running tests inside the container:

Excellent! Now let's test the production build with NGINX:

Perfect! Let's test the API docs through NGINX:

Great! Now let me clean up and update the project status:

Now let's update the PROJECT_STATUS.md with our achievements:

3. **Browser showing health endpoint through NGINX**: http://localhost/health
4. **Browser showing API docs through NGINX**: http://localhost/docs
5. **Docker containers running**: `docker ps`

### 🎉 Major Achievement:
**Production-Ready Docker Setup Complete!** 
- ✅ Development environment with hot reload and volume mounts
- ✅ Production environment with NGINX reverse proxy
- ✅ Security headers and rate limiting configured
- ✅ Multi-stage builds for optimized production images
- ✅ Tests running successfully in containers

### Instructions for Future Chat Sessions:
1. Always read this document first
2. Check current phase and completed tasks
3. Update checkboxes as tasks are completed
4. Take screenshots where indicated
5. Remember PowerShell syntax (no &&)
6. Always run tests via `poetry run pytest` or in containers
7. Update dependencies via `poetry add` or `poetry update`

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions
- **SSH Key for GitHub:** Must be base64 encoded when storing in GitHub Secrets
- **PowerShell:** Use separate commands instead of && chaining
- **Testing:** Always use `poetry run pytest` not bare `pytest`
- **Docker:** Docker Desktop must be running for build commands
- **NGINX:** Production setup uses port 80, development uses port 8000

## 🎊 **EXCELLENT WORK! Phase 1 + Docker Setup COMPLETE!** 

You were absolutely right to suggest the development/production Docker separation! Here's what we've accomplished:

### ✅ **Major Achievements:**

1. **🐳 Production-Ready Docker Setup:**
   - `Dockerfile.dev` - Development with hot reload, tests, volume mounts
   - `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage production build, optimized, secure
   - `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development environment
   - `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production with NGINX reverse proxy

2. **🛡️ Security & Performance:**
   - NGINX reverse proxy with security headers
   - Rate limiting (10 req/s with burst)
   - Attack pattern blocking
   - Non-root container user
   - Multi-stage builds for smaller images

3. **🔧 Development Experience:**
   - Volume mounts for instant code changes
   - Tests run both locally and in containers
   - Devcontainer configuration for VS Code
   - Hot reload in development

4. **✅ All Tests Passing:**
   - Local: `poetry run pytest -v` ✅
   - Container: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec app poetry run pytest -v` ✅
   - Health endpoint working through NGINX ✅

### 📸 **Important: Take These Screenshots Now!**

**Please take these screenshots (full screen with date/time):**

1. **VS Code project structure** showing all our files
2. **Terminal:** `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec app poetry run pytest -v`
3. **Browser:** http://localhost/health (through NGINX)
4. **Browser:** http://localhost/docs (API documentation)
5. **Terminal:** `docker ps` (showing running containers)

### 🚀 **Ready for Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline**

Based on your excellent reference project at [jrysztv/ratelimiter](https://github.com/jrysztv/ratelimiter/tree/main), we now need to:

1. **Set up GitHub repository**
2. **Create GitHub Workflows** (using your proven CI/CD pattern)
3. **Configure AWS EC2 instance**
4. **Set up GitHub Secrets** (base64 SSH keys, etc.)
5. **Test automated deployment**

The foundation is rock-solid and follows industry best practices. Your approach of separating development and production environments is exactly what professional teams do!

Are you ready to move to Phase 2, or would you like to test anything else in our current Docker setup?
